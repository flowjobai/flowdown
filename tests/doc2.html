<h1><a id=\"_1x911kqk21wf\"></a>Simplicity Meets Affordability</h1>
<p>A <strong>modern architectural styled panel</strong> with <s>striking</s> vertical pickets <strong>closely
        <em>spaced</em></strong> to accentuate the vertical lines of the house. This design doesn't have any posts - it
    bolts directly into the deck joists or concrete verandah. The design is Pool safety compliant at 1.2m high. These
    custom made balustrade panels with a 250mm plate to secure the panel to the deck joists are fully compliant with
    council regulations and come with a producer statement to verify it.</p>
<p>Finn Balustrade Panels are all custom made in our Silverdale factory and can be supplied with matching pedestrian
    gates. Driveway gates will be made to the size of your driveway in our fabrication department. And can be supplied
    with suitable gate motors for a qualified technician to install. Typical lead times are 2-3 weeks.</p>
