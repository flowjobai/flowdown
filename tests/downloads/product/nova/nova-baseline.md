# Simplicity Meets Affordability
A modern architectural styled panel with striking vertical pickets closely spaced to accentuate the vertical lines of the house. This design doesn't have any posts - it bolts directly into the deck joists or concrete verandah. The design is Pool safety compliant at 1.2m high. These custom made balustrade panels with a 250mm plate to secure the panel to the deck joists are fully compliant with council regulations and come with a producer statement to verify it.

Finn Balustrade Panels are all custom made in our Silverdale factory and can be supplied with matching pedestrian gates. Driveway gates will be made to the size of your driveway in our fabrication department. And can be supplied with suitable gate motors for a qualified technician to install. Typical lead times are 2-3 weeks.
